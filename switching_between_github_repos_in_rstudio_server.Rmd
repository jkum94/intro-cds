In the last tutorial, we learned how to clone a repository from GitHub to RStudio Server. Now, we will see how to switch from one repository to another in RStudio Server. 

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
# DO NOT ALTER THIS CHUNK
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.width = 5,
  fig.asp = 0.618, out.width = "100%", dpi = 120,
  fig.align = "center", cache = TRUE, dev = "svg"
)
```

### Step - 1

Log in to your RStudio Server account on <https://rstudio.cos.gmu.edu/>. You can see your current repository on the right side (cube containing R icon) button on RStudo Server screen. Currently, I am working in the "rstudio-server-tutorial" repository, and there are two other repositories which I have already cloned from GitHub ("test" and "github-tutorial").

To switch from one repository to another click on the right side (cube containing R icon) button and then click on the repository which you want to access. In this case, I want to move from "rstudio-server-tutorial" repository to "test" repository. (While performing tutorial, please note that you will have different repositories) 

```{r step_1}
knitr::include_graphics("img/switch_step_1.jpg")
```

### Step - 2

After clicking on the name of the repository, RStudio Server will switch to the respective repository. You can verify the repository by checking its name on the right side button.

```{r step_2}
knitr::include_graphics("img/switch_step_2.jpg")
```

In this way, you can quickly switch from one repository to another in RStudio Server. If a particular repository is not available in RStudio Server then first you need to clone that repository from GitHub, and then you can use that repository in RStudio Server.
