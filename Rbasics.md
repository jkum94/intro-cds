# R basics



You should complete this chapter within the first week of class. We will be using these concepts in every assignment for the rest of the semester, so it is important to become familiar with them.

As you work through the sections of this chapter you should answer the accompanying questions on Blackboard.

## Data {#rbasics-data}

The central component of everything we will be doing in R this semester is **data**. Even non-data science programs revolve around data. At a very basic level, a computer is just a fancy calculator that takes in numbers and spits out an answer. To a computer, even things like words and pictures are stored internally as numbers.

### Numbers {#rbasics-numbers}

R can handle many types of data. For example, one type of data is a number. Let's start by 

When you open RStudio, you will notice that the program is divided up into 3 or 4 panes. On the left, you should see a pane called **Console**. You can type programming language **expressions** into the Console after the `>` symbol, hit enter, and the expression will be **evaluated**.

Try entering a number after the `>` in the Console (e.g. 2), then Enter, and see what happens.

When you hit enter, the R interpreter reads in the line, evaluates it, and returns the answer. In this case, you entered 2, so the computer thinks “Hey, it’s a 2! Wow, a two! The result of 2 is… drum roll, please… 2!” and you get a two.

Cool! But not, I confess, particularly useful. Let’s fix that: next we’ll add two numbers together. At the prompt, enter two numbers separated by a plus sign, +

`> 2 + 2`

What do you get?

The plus sign, +, is called an operator. As you might expect, it is the addition operator. There are many other operators in R.

<!-- ### How to import a repository -->

<!-- To import a repository from other account click on "+" sign and then click on "Import repository" option. After that, you need to provide a link of other repository which you need to clone or import and the repository name to store on your GitHub account. After giving all the details click on "Begin import" button. -->

<!-- ```{r getting-to-know-step_6, click.img = TRUE} -->
<!-- knitr::include_graphics("img/repository_step_6.jpg") -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- The import process will start, and you will get a notification after completion of the import process. -->

<!-- ```{r getting-to-know-step_7, click.img = TRUE} -->
<!-- knitr::include_graphics("img/repository_step_7.jpg") -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- In the end, you will be able to see the imported repository in your GitHub account. -->

<!-- ```{r getting-to-know-step_8, click.img = TRUE} -->
<!-- knitr::include_graphics("img/repository_step_8.jpg") -->
<!-- ``` -->
