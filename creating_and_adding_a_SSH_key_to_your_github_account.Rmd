```


In this tutorial, we will learn step by step how to create and add an SSH key to your GitHub account.

### Step - 1

Log in to your RStudio Server account on <https://rstudio.cos.gmu.edu/>. When RStudio Server will start then click on "Tools" option in the menu bar and then click on "Global Options..."

```{r step_1}
knitr::include_graphics("img/SSH_Step_1.jpg")
```

### Step - 2

After clicking "Global Options..." you will see a new window containing different options. From that window click on "Git/SVN" which will be present on the left side and then click on "Create RSA key".

```{r step_2}
knitr::include_graphics("img/SSH_Step_2.jpg")
```

### Step - 3

A new window will open, and there will be two textboxes. One textbox will be for entering a passphrase, and other will be for confirmation. Adding a passphrase will be an optional part. After that click on "Create" button and a new window will appear containing information about RSA key pair. Now, you can close that window by clicking on "Close" button.  

```{r step_3}
knitr::include_graphics("img/SSH_Step_3.jpg")
```

```{r step_4}
knitr::include_graphics("img/SSH_Step_4.jpg")
```


### Step - 4

Click on the "View public key" option which will open another new window containing public key. After opening that window copy the public key and close the window.

```{r step_5}
knitr::include_graphics("img/SSH_Step_5.jpg")
```

```{r step_6}
knitr::include_graphics("img/SSH_Step_6.jpg")
```

### Step - 5

In the last step, we successfully generated a public key. Now, we need to add that public key to our GitHub account. To do that go to <https://github.com/> and login to your account. After logging in click on your profile picture and then click on "Settings" option in the list. 

```{r step_7}
knitr::include_graphics("img/SSH_Step_7.jpg")
```

### Step - 6

You will see a list of options to configure your GitHub account. Now from the list click on "SSH and GPG keys" option.

```{r step_8}
knitr::include_graphics("img/SSH_Step_8.jpg")
```

### Step - 7

There will be two sections SSH keys and GPG keys. Click on "New SSH key" button.

```{r step_9}
knitr::include_graphics("img/SSH_Step_9.jpg")
```

### Step - 8

After clicking "New SSH key" button, we need to specify details of SSH key. In the first textbox, you need to give a title to the key and in the second textbox paste the copied key. After entering these details click on "Add SSH key" button.

```{r step_10}
knitr::include_graphics("img/SSH_Step_10.jpg")
```

### Step - 9

If all the steps were followed correctly, then you will see a key in SSH keys section.

```{r step_11}
knitr::include_graphics("img/SSH_Step_11.jpg")
```
