## Getting to know the Github repository page

In this tutorial, we will learn how to create, import and download repository from GitHub.

### Creating a repository

#### Step - 1

We saw in the last tutorial that after creating an account on GitHub, there are three ways to create a repository. The most common method of creating a repository is to click on "+" sign and then click on "New repository" option.

```{r getting-to-know-step_1, click.img = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/repository_step_1.jpg")
```

#### Step - 2

After clicking on "New repository" you will go to a new screen where you need to give a repository name. You will also find two options to either keep repository as public or private. In the end, there will be another option to initialize the repository with Readme.md file.

```{r getting-to-know-step_2, click.img = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/repository_step_2.jpg")
```

#### Step - 3

GitHub doesn't allow to create a repository without a name. Thus, it is mandatory to give a name to the repository. After providing all the details and selecting appropriate options click on "Create repository" button.

```{r getting-to-know-step_3, click.img = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/repository_step_3.jpg")
```

#### Step - 4

In this way, the repository will be successfully created. If you have ticked on initializing the repository with Readme.md file, then you will find the file in the repository. You can easily edit Readme.md file by clicking on the file.

```{r getting-to-know-step_4, click.img = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/repository_step_4.jpg")
```

#### Step - 5

After clicking Readme.md file if you want to add any content in that file then click on the pencil symbol. Click on "Commit" button after making changes in the file.

```{r getting-to-know-step_5, click.img = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/repository_step_5.jpg")
```

### Importing a repository

#### Step - 1

To import repository from other account click on "+" sign and then click on "Import repository" option. After that, you need to provide a link of other repository which you need to clone or import and the repository name to store on your GitHub account. After giving all the details click on "Begin import" button.

```{r getting-to-know-step_6, click.img = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/repository_step_6.jpg")
```

#### Step - 2

The import process will start, and you will get a notification after completion of the import process.

```{r getting-to-know-step_7, click.img = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/repository_step_7.jpg")
```

#### Step - 3

In the end, you will be able to see the imported repository in your GitHub account.

```{r getting-to-know-step_8, click.img = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/repository_step_8.jpg")
```

### Downloading a repository

The simplest way to download any repository on GitHub is to click on that repository and then click on "Clone or download" button. After that, a menu will appear and then click on "Download ZIP" option. In this way, you will be able to download any repository on your local drive.

```{r getting-to-know-step_9, click.img = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/repository_step_9.jpg")
```

## Creating and adding an SSH key to your Github account

In this tutorial, we will learn step by step how to create and add an SSH key to your GitHub account.

#### Step - 1

Log in to your RStudio Server account on <https://rstudio.cos.gmu.edu/>. When RStudio Server will start then click on "Tools" option in the menu bar and then click on "Global Options..."

```{r ssh-key-step_1, click.img = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/SSH_Step_1.jpg")
```

#### Step - 2

After clicking "Global Options..." you will see a new window containing different options. From that window click on "Git/SVN" which will be present on the left side and then click on "Create RSA key".

```{r ssh-key-step_2, click.img = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/SSH_Step_2.jpg")
```

#### Step - 3

A new window will open, and there will be two textboxes. One textbox will be for entering a passphrase, and other will be for confirmation. Adding a passphrase will be an optional part. After that click on "Create" button and a new window will appear containing information about RSA key pair. Now, you can close that window by clicking on "Close" button.

```{r ssh-key-step_3, click.img = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/SSH_Step_3.jpg")
```

```{r ssh-key-step_4, click.img = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/SSH_Step_4.jpg")
```

#### Step - 4

Click on the "View public key" option which will open another new window containing public key. After opening that window copy the public key and close the window.

```{r ssh-key-step_5, click.img = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/SSH_Step_5.jpg")
```

```{r ssh-key-step_6, click.img = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/SSH_Step_6.jpg")
```

#### Step - 5

In the last step, we successfully generated a public key. Now, we need to add that public key to our GitHub account. To do that go to <https://github.com/> and login to your account. After logging in click on your profile picture and then click on "Settings" option in the list.

```{r ssh-key-step_7, click.img = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/SSH_Step_7.jpg")
```

#### Step - 6

You will see a list of options to configure your GitHub account. Now from the list click on "SSH and GPG keys" option.

```{r ssh-key-step_8, click.img = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/SSH_Step_8.jpg")
```

#### Step - 7

There will be two sections SSH keys and GPG keys. Click on "New SSH key" button.

```{r ssh-key-step_9, click.img = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/SSH_Step_9.jpg")
```

#### Step - 8

After clicking "New SSH key" button, we need to specify details of SSH key. In the first textbox, you need to give a title to the key and in the second textbox paste the copied key. After entering these details click on "Add SSH key" button.

```{r ssh-key-step_10, click.img = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/SSH_Step_10.jpg")
```

#### Step - 9

If all the steps were followed correctly, then you will see a key in SSH keys section.

```{r ssh-key-step_11, click.img = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/SSH_Step_11.jpg")
```
